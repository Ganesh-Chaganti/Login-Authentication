# Login Authentication
 Login authentication is a security process used to verify the identity of a user attempting to access a system, application, or network. It involves the user providing credentials, typically a username and password, which the system then checks against its database to determine if the credentials match those on record. This login authentication has been created by using HTML and CSS.
